# seven-segments
controlling seven segment using atmega 32 microcontroller

**language used:** C 

**microcontroller:** Atmega32

**peripherals:** 7 segment led display

**libraries:** DIO.h - macros.h - seven_segment.h - BUTTON.h - seven_segment_bcd.h

**emulator:** proteus 7.7

**example 1:** a code to display numbers from 0 to 9 with a delay 1 second on common cathode seven segment which connected to port D  and the display will be repeated.

**example 2:** a code to display numbers from 0 to F with a delay 1 second on common cathode seven segment which connected to port D  and the display will be repeated.

**example 3:** a code to display numbers from 0 to 9 with a delay 1 second on common cathode seven segment which connected to port D  and the display will be repeated.

**example 4:** a code to increase the value which is written to seven segment after each press on push button and if the value reaches 9  then it will be 0 in the next press (use common cathode seven segment).

**example 5:** a code to implement the same example 1 but by using Bcd to seven segment decoder
